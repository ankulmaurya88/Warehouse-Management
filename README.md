Here, I am describing the Backend part of warehouse management 
# Produce Warehouse Management System 
Project Overview 
The Produce Warehouse Management System is a Flask-based web application 
designed to manage the operations of a direct-to-consumer (D2C) produce 
warehouse. This system includes features to handle the reception, 
storage, management, and traceability of produce, ensuring compliance 
with supply chain traceability and bio-degradable packaging standards. 
The application is structured to support multiple temperature zones and 
predict the shelf life of produce items.

2.1 Receiving Produce 
The application allows the warehouse to receive produce shipments. The 
received produce is stored in a database with details such as name, 
source, quantity, storage zone, packaging type, and shelf life.

3.1 Flask Framework 
The application is built using Flask, a lightweight and versatile Python 
web framework that facilitates rapid development and scalability. Flask's 
modular design allows for the separation of concerns through blueprints, 
making the application easy to extend.

3.2 Database Management 
The application uses SQL Alchemy for Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) and 
SQLite as the database. This setup allows for easy database operations 
management, including migrations and schema management through Flask
Migrate.
